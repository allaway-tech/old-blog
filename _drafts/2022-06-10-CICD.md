# My first foray into CI/CD
A few days ago I came across a youtube video that showed Jekyll being used to generate a static site. This interested me and after doing some extra reading I found that it was also possible to create a blog with it as well. Even better than that it is possible to host this blog for free on github.

## Some back story
This blog originally started life as a WordPress blog on amazon's AWS EC2 servers. However, once my free tier expired I started getting a bill of around £7 per month for minimal traffic to the site. I had been using Linode servers for a few other projects and decided that I was going to migrate the blog to a ghost CMS site on their smalles node. This should have brought prices down to around £4 a month. But as always migration was slow and so I just ended up paying £11 for a blog split across 2 servers. Not ideal! So what to do now? Well, I've exported the contents of the WordPress blog and imported it to a stack running on my local docker server. I now plan to pull the relevent posts off the local server and migrate them into here. During this process I realised that GitHub Actions was the answer I was looking for in maintaining a few docker images I have.
