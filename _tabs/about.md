Hi and Welcome to my blog.

I am a West End tech with a bias towards sound who enjoys tinkering with electronics and coding/scripting in my free time. Currently I fall into the sysadmin/dev-ops categories and self-host some of the tools we use both at work and at home.

Things that I am planning to be posting about:
- Digital audio
- Digital theatre system
- Raspberry Pi‚Äôs
- PureData
- Node js
- Shell scripting
- Ubuntu
- and Anything else related to any projects I do.

I am fitting writing this blog around doing the projects; chasing my 18-month-old daughter round, to stop her eating everything; and being back to work so posts may come in slowly.

## Grammar, phrasing, abbreviations and other almost relevant stuff
Here I am collating a list of, as the heading implies, grammar, phrasing, abbreviations and other stuff I have decided to use. If you disagree with me good for you. If you really can‚Äôt stand one I have decided to use go ahead and leave a comment on it, I will probably ignore it but if it makes you feel better to vent then good for you. üôÇ
- Camel casing product names i.e. Raspberry Pi instead of raspberry pi
- Raspberry Pi versions abbreviating to the form PiVersionModel i.e. Pi2B
- A Rabbit Hole ‚Äì a project I have started investing time on that is probably completely futile
- Not putting punctuation on the end of list items
- The plural of Raspberry Pi is Pi‚Äôs. Pis just looks wrong üòê
- Not capitalising the first letter of a camel case word i.e theQuickBrownFox not TheQuickBrownFox
- I will write a camel case phrase before abbreviating it in brackets i.e. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

So once again Hi and Welcome to my blog.
