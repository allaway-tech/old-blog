Unfortunately, I have not been blogging over the last 6 months or so. This is because I have returned to my full-time job on the West End and due to many Covid complications I have not had the time or the will to be blogging. Now that we have now bedded into our second cast and things are running much more smoothly, I have a bit more time on my hands. I am currently working on a post about my first attempt at CI/CD, but if there is a topic you think I should write about (preferably relating to theatre sound or lighting) then pop in a comment and I will see about writing some content on it.
Hopefully, my next post will be out in a week or so, and then a couple of times a month from there onwards.
